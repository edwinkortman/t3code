# Omp ACP recon findings (live capture vs `omp acp` 16.1.22)

Captured by `apps/server/scripts/omp-acp-recon.ts` on 2026-06-26.
Run: `node apps/server/scripts/omp-acp-recon.ts` (must run from apps/server so
`effect-acp` resolves via workspace node_modules).

## CONFIRMED (gaps closed)

- **protocolVersion**: `1`.
- **agentInfo**: `{ name: "oh-my-pi", title: "Oh My Pi", version: "16.1.22" }`.
- **Auth (terminal-free target hit)**: advertising `clientCapabilities.fs` +
  `terminal` and NOT `auth.terminal`, omp returns exactly ONE auth method:
  `{ id: "agent", name: "Use existing local credentials", description:
  "Authenticate via the provider keys/OAuth state already configured under ~/.omp." }`.
  → `authMethodId = "agent"`. `authenticate({methodId:"agent"})` returns `{}` (ok).
- **agentCapabilities**: `loadSession: true`; `mcpCapabilities: { http, sse }`;
  `promptCapabilities: { embeddedContext, image }`;
  `sessionCapabilities: { list, fork, resume, close }`
  → session rewind/fork (Phase 2) is supported by the agent.
- **session/new** returns `configOptions` + `modes`:
  - `mode` (select): `default` | `plan` ("Read-only planning mode that drafts a
    plan to a markdown file before any code changes"). Current: `default`.
  - `thinking` (select): `off` | `auto` (auto-detect low–xhigh per prompt).
  - `modes.availableModes`: default, plan.
  → Mode is driven via the config-option channel, not a distinct set_mode verb.
- **Wire**: standard Zed ACP (session/new, session/prompt, configOptions). No
  omp-specific extension request seen in the handshake. The generic
  `AcpRuntimeModel` / GrokAdapter event mapping should apply directly.

## STILL OPEN — blocked on omp having a model configured (NOT a protocol gap)

`session/prompt` failed immediately with:
```
-32603 Internal error: "No model selected.
Use /login, set an API key environment variable, or create
/home/edwin/.omp/agent/agent.db  Then use /model to select a model."
```
Because the turn never ran, these remain uncaptured:
- `session/update` variant shapes during a real edit turn (agent_message_chunk,
  agent_thought_chunk, tool_call, tool_call_update, plan).
- `available_commands_update` contents (the /plan /model /compact list).
- Whether omp calls back `fs/write_text_file` and `terminal/*` on the client
  during a turn (the mechanism that routes writes into T3 Code's diff viewer).
- Real omp model ids (even `/model` listing needs configured creds).

### Action required (USER, one-time)
Configure a model for omp so a turn can run, e.g. set a provider API key env var,
run `omp` and `/login`, or otherwise create `~/.omp/agent/agent.db` with a
selected model. Then re-run the recon to capture the turn-level shapes above.

## TURN VALIDATED (2026-06-27, authenticated omp, real streamed turn)

Ran the recon prompt "List the files in this repo and stop." with a logged-in
Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max) account. Turn streamed end-to-end: 210
`session/update` notifications, `stopReason: "end_turn"`, no errors.

`session/update` variants omp actually emits:
- `agent_message_chunk` — `{content:{type:"text",text}, messageId}` → mapped to ContentDelta.
- `agent_thought_chunk` — same shape; currently IGNORED by AcpRuntimeModel default
  branch (thoughts not rendered; matches Grok behavior).
- `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` — mapped to ToolCallUpdated. The file read came
  through here as `{kind:"read"}`.
- `available_commands_update` — commands over ACP: advisor, browser, dump, export,
  fast, model, share. (/plan, /compact, /login, /quit are TUI-filtered, absent.)
- `session_info_update` — omp-specific `{sessionId, updatedAt}`; IGNORED safely.
- `usage_update` — omp-specific `{size, used, cost:{amount,currency}}`; IGNORED safely.

prompt RESULT: `{stopReason:"end_turn", usage:{inputTokens, outputTokens,
totalTokens, cachedReadTokens}}`.

Verified the server handles all of this: effect-acp `schema.gen.ts` already knows
`session_info_update`/`usage_update`; `AcpRuntimeModel` translate switch
(apps/server/.../acp/AcpRuntimeModel.ts:516) maps the standard variants and
`default: break` ignores the rest — no crash, no code change needed.

### Two corrected assumptions
- **No model id over ACP.** session/new exposes only mode + thinking config
  options. omp picks the model from its own config / `/model`. OmpProvider's
  ACP model-discovery premise is invalid (comment updated; placeholder model kept).
- **Reads internal, WRITES delegated to the client.** The read surfaced only as a
  `tool_call (kind:read)` with ZERO `fs/read_text_file` callbacks — omp reads via
  its own tool. But a write turn (create /tmp/omp-write-test.txt) produced BOTH:
  (1) a `tool_call {kind:"edit", status:"pending", rawInput:{path,content},
  locations:[{path}]}` — the diff card — and (2) a callback to
  `fs/write_text_file({path, content})` on the client. So the original
  diff-viewer premise HOLDS: omp hands writes to the client's fs/write handler,
  which T3 Code's generic AcpSessionRuntime already routes into its diff/worktree
  pipeline. No adapter code change needed. (The file stays absent in recon only
  because the recon's fs/write handler is log-only.) No `session/request_permission`
  fired for the edit — T3 gates at the diff boundary.

## Adapter implications
- `acp/OmpAcpSupport.ts`: `OMP_AUTH_METHOD_ID = "agent"` is CONFIRMED (drop the
  TODO(omp-recon) on it).
- Mode wiring (Phase 1f): expose `mode` config option (default/plan) +
  `thinking` (off/auto).
- Since omp is standard ACP, `Layers/OmpAdapter.ts` can mirror GrokAdapter with
  the xAI ask_user_question handlers removed; turn-shape validation pending the
  model-config action above.
